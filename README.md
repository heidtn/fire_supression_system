# Fire Supression System
This is the arduino control code (runs on an ESP8266 NODE MCU) that controls the fire supression system for my 3D printer.

Disclaimer: this system is purely educational and will probably not stop any fires.  (with the way I built it, it's more likely to catch on fire).

### Overview
When a MQ-2 sensor detects smoke it triggers a relay, that's the essence of this code.  More details can be found on the blog post here: http://martiancastaway.com/setup/2020/10/24/FIRE.html
